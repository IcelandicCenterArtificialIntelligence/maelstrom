# Maelstrom Base

This library contains fundamental data structures used by all Maelstrom code,
including the message data structures for the various inter-process protocols.
Unlike [maelstrom-util](../maelstrom-util), this library is intended to be used
in WASM as well as native architectures.

For more information, see the [Maelstrom project on
GitHub](https://github.com/maelstrom-software/maelstrom).
