# Clustered Job Runner Management

Both the broker and the worker can be configured using either the command line
or via a configuration file. See their specific pages for more information
- [Broker Configuration](./clustered_job_runner_management/broker.md)
- [Worker Configuration](./clustered_job_runner_management/worker.md)

The broker can be monitored using the
[web UI](./clustered_job_runner_management/web_ui.md). It runs an HTTP server on
the configured HTTP port.
